✨ About me

🧪 I’m Yani — extremely curious and building a research portfolio one dataset at a time.

🗺️ Exploring urban data, housing markets, and how people live.

🎯 Current focus: tabulating, cleaning, and standardizing historical listings for a proposal.

🌱 Learning: better geospatial workflows, OCR, and storytelling with maps + charts.

💬 Ask me about: turning messy listings into tidy tables.

🐛 Fun fact: I keep a “hall of fame” for my funniest parsing fails.

“Measure twice, parse once.”
